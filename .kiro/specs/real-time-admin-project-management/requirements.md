# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables comprehensive real-time project management capabilities for administrators and seamless synchronization of project assignments and LinkedIn URLs across all users. The system will allow admins to manage projects (add/remove), assign/reassign users to projects, and ensure that all changes—including LinkedIn URLs pasted by users—are instantly visible to all relevant parties (admins, RTNP users) without requiring page refreshes. This creates a truly collaborative, real-time environment for project and user management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Admin Project CRUD Operations

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create, view, update, and delete projects in the system, so that I can maintain an accurate list of active projects for assignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new project THEN the system SHALL save the project to the database and broadcast the change to all connected clients in real-time
2. WHEN an admin updates project details THEN the system SHALL persist the changes and notify all connected clients without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN an admin deletes a project THEN the system SHALL remove the project, handle any user assignments appropriately, and update all connected clients instantly
4. WHEN a project is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes on the RTNP dashboard, admin panel, and all user views within 1 second
5. IF a project has assigned users WHEN the admin attempts to delete it THEN the system SHALL either reassign users or handle the deletion gracefully with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 2: Admin User Project Assignment Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to assign, reassign, or remove project assignments for any user, so that I can manage team allocations and workload distribution effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin assigns a user to a project THEN the system SHALL create the assignment and broadcast the change to all connected clients in real-time
2. WHEN an admin changes a user's project assignment THEN the system SHALL update the assignment and notify the affected user and all RTNP viewers instantly
3. WHEN an admin removes a user from a project THEN the system SHALL delete the assignment and update all relevant dashboards without refresh
4. WHEN any project assignment changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the user's individual dashboard, RTNP dashboard, and admin panel simultaneously
5. IF multiple admins make conflicting changes simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts using last-write-wins or optimistic locking strategy

### Requirement 3: Admin LinkedIn URL Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to delete and download any LinkedIn URL from the system, so that I can manage data quality and export information as needed.

5. IF an admin deletes a LinkedIn URL entry THEN the system SHALL log the action in the audit trail with admin user ID and timestamp
6. WHEN an admin downloads data THEN the system SHALL include all fields (LinkedIn URL, full name, company, city, job title, email, phone numbers, status)

### Requirement 4: Real-Time LinkedIn URL Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to paste LinkedIn URLs into my sheet and have them appear instantly for RTNP users and admins, so that my profile information is immediately available without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes a LinkedIn URL into their sheet THEN the system SHALL capture the input and broadcast it to all connected RTNP users and admins within 1 second
2. WHEN a LinkedIn URL is updated THEN the system SHALL display the new URL on the RTNP dashboard and admin panel without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN multiple users update their LinkedIn URLs simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle all updates independently and broadcast each change correctly
4. IF a user clears or modifies their LinkedIn URL THEN the system SHALL reflect the change in real-time across all connected clients
5. WHEN a LinkedIn URL is pasted THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and provide immediate feedback to the user

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Data Synchronization Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system, I need to maintain persistent real-time connections with all clients, so that changes can be propagated instantly without polling or manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the application THEN the system SHALL establish a real-time connection using WebSockets or Supabase Realtime
2. WHEN any data change occurs (project, assignment, LinkedIn URL) THEN the system SHALL broadcast the change to all subscribed clients within 1 second
3. IF a client loses connection THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically and sync any missed changes
4. WHEN a client reconnects after a disconnection THEN the system SHALL fetch and apply any changes that occurred during the disconnection
5. WHEN the system broadcasts changes THEN it SHALL only send updates to clients that have permission to view the data

### Requirement 6: Multi-User Concurrent Access and Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As the system, I need to handle multiple users making changes simultaneously, so that data integrity is maintained and users see consistent information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple admins modify the same project simultaneously THEN the system SHALL apply a conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins or optimistic locking)
2. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL ensure database consistency and prevent data corruption
3. IF a conflict is detected THEN the system SHALL notify affected users and provide options to resolve the conflict
4. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of who made what changes and when
5. WHEN the system detects a stale update THEN it SHALL reject the update and prompt the user to refresh their view

### Requirement 7: Permission-Based Real-Time Updates

**User Story:** As the system, I need to ensure that users only receive real-time updates for data they have permission to view, so that security and privacy are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN broadcasting project changes THEN the system SHALL only send updates to admins and users assigned to those projects
2. WHEN broadcasting user assignment changes THEN the system SHALL notify the affected user, admins, and RTNP viewers with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN broadcasting LinkedIn URL changes THEN the system SHALL send updates to admins and RTNP users who have permission to view user profiles
4. IF a user's permissions change THEN the system SHALL update their real-time subscriptions accordingly
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL terminate their real-time subscriptions and clean up resources

### Requirement 8: RTNP Dashboard Real-Time Integration
